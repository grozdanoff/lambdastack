# Fork-and-Branch Git Workflow

LambdaStack uses the Fork-and-Branch Git Workflow. The basics steps are:

- Fork a the LambdaStack GitHub repository.
- Clone the forked repository to your local system.
- Add the Git remote for the original LambdaStack repository.
- Create a feature branch in which to place your changes.
- Make your changes to the new branch.
- Commit the changes to the branch.
- Push the branch to GitHub.
- Open a pull request from the new branch to the original LambdaStack repo.
- Clean up after your pull request is merged.
